##  Overview

The irrelevant-content-detection project is a sophisticated software tool that leverages TF-IDF vectors to analyze text relevance and effectively identify and clean irrelevant content within text and HTML documents. With a crucial focus on parsing HTML to extract textual information, this project serves as a valuable asset for users aiming to efficiently detect and remove irrelevant data from their textual content.

---

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**  | Python project structured with a main detector module for analyzing text relevance using TF-IDF vectors. The extraction of relevant text from HTML is crucial for identifying and removing irrelevant content. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase follows standard Python conventions with clear variable names and well-documented functions. Code is structured and readable, adhering to PEP 8 guidelines for consistency. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | Limited documentation available. Could benefit from more detailed explanations on module usage and code functionalities. The `setup.py` provides metadata info, but code-specific documentation is lacking. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Relies on Python and setup tools for project dependencies. External libraries like `nltk` and `beautifulsoup4` might be used for text parsing and analysis. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The project exhibits modularity with a separate detector module for text relevance analysis. Codebase could be further structured for enhanced reusability and maintainability. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | Testing frameworks and tools are not explicitly mentioned in the repository. Adding unit tests using tools like `unittest` or `pytest` would enhance code reliability. |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**   | Efficiency could be improved by optimizing text parsing and relevance analysis algorithms. Resource usage may vary depending on the size and complexity of input text. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | No specific security measures mentioned. Implementing data sanitization techniques and access controls is recommended for handling sensitive information securely. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include Python for the project runtime, along with setup tools specified in `setup.py` for package management. Additional libraries like `nltk` and `beautifulsoup4` may be used. |
